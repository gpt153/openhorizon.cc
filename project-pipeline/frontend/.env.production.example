# Production Environment Variables for Project Pipeline Frontend
# Copy this file to .env.production and update values as needed

# WebSocket URL (optional - defaults to window.location.origin in production)
# Only set this if you need to override the default behavior
# VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-frontend-url.com

# Note: In the default setup, the frontend uses Nginx to proxy WebSocket
# connections to the backend, so no explicit VITE_SOCKET_URL is needed.
# The socket.io client will connect to the same origin as the frontend,
# and Nginx will route /socket.io requests to the backend.
