# Seeds - AI-Powered Project Ideation

## What is a Seed?

A **seed** is an AI-generated project idea based on your brainstorming prompt. Think of it as the starting point for your Erasmus+ project - a rough concept that can be refined, saved for later, or converted directly into a full project.

## Why Use Seeds?

- **Fast ideation** - Generate 5-15 diverse ideas in seconds
- **Overcome writer's block** - Let AI suggest creative angles
- **Explore options** - Compare different approaches before committing
- **Save time** - Skip hours of brainstorming meetings
- **Build a library** - Save promising ideas for future projects

## How Seeds Work

### 1. Generate Seeds

From your dashboard, click **"Generate New Project Ideas"** and enter a brainstorming prompt.

**What makes a good prompt?**

✅ **Good prompts include:**
- Theme or topic (e.g., "digital skills", "climate action")
- Target group (e.g., "youth ages 16-20", "youth workers")
- Countries or locations (e.g., "Sweden and Poland", "Barcelona")
- Rough duration (e.g., "5-day exchange", "week-long training")

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
"Youth exchange about climate action in Sweden, Poland, and Germany for ages 16-20"
"Training course for youth workers on digital storytelling, 5 days in Barcelona"
"Mobility project about social entrepreneurship for young adults from rural areas"
```

❌ **Too vague:**
```
"Project"
"Something about environment"
"Youth"
```

❌ **Too specific:**
```
"5-day youth exchange in Malmo from June 15-20 with 24 participants doing workshops on renewable energy from 9am-5pm each day"
```

**Tip:** Be descriptive but flexible. Give AI enough context to generate relevant ideas, but leave room for creativity.

### 2. Review Generated Seeds

Each seed includes:

- **Informal Title** - Catchy, relatable name (e.g., "Digital Nomads Unite!")
- **Informal Description** - Friendly overview in plain language
- **Formal Title** - Erasmus+ application-ready name (e.g., "Digital Skills Mobility for Rural Youth")
- **Formal Description** - EU grant language suitable for submission
- **Target Group** - Age range, background, special needs
- **Activities Snapshot** - 3-5 example activities
- **Estimated Participants** - Suggested group size
- **Duration** - Recommended timeline
- **Approval Likelihood** - AI-predicted score (1-100)
- **Why It's a Good Idea** - AI reasoning and justification

**Understanding the approval likelihood:**
- **80-100** - Strong concept aligned with Erasmus+ priorities
- **60-79** - Good concept, may need refinement
- **40-59** - Viable but requires significant development
- **Below 40** - May not align well with Erasmus+ objectives

### 3. Decide What to Do

For each seed, you have three options:

**Save to Garden**
- Store promising ideas for later
- Build a library of concepts
- Revisit when you have time to develop them

**Elaborate**
- Refine the idea through AI conversation
- Adjust target group, activities, objectives
- Perfect the concept before creating a project

**Convert to Project**
- Skip elaboration and create a full project immediately
- Best for ideas that are already well-formed
- You can still edit everything later

## Elaborating Seeds

Elaboration is an AI-powered conversational interview that transforms your seed into structured, Erasmus+-ready project data in under 2 minutes.

### Two Types of Elaboration

**1. Conversational Elaboration (Recommended)** 🆕
- AI guides you through **7 essential questions**
- Extracts structured metadata from natural language
- Auto-calculates budgets, timelines, visa requirements
- Real-time completeness tracking (0-100%)
- Enables project conversion at 80%+
- **Time: 1-2 minutes**

**[→ See Complete Walkthrough Guide](seed-elaboration.md)** for detailed instructions with examples and screenshots.

**2. Free-Form Elaboration (Advanced)**
- Conversational refinement for specific tweaks
- Ask AI to adjust target groups, activities, objectives
- Build iteratively through back-and-forth discussion
- Best for minor refinements to well-formed seeds

### When to Use Conversational Elaboration

Use the **7-question guided elaboration** when:
- ✅ You need structured project data for conversion
- ✅ You want to validate against Erasmus+ requirements
- ✅ You're uncertain about project parameters
- ✅ You want AI to auto-calculate budgets and visa needs
- ✅ You need quick results (<2 minutes)

### When to Use Free-Form Elaboration

Use **free-form elaboration** when:
- The seed is close but needs minor tweaking
- You want to explore specific activity types
- Target group needs adjustment
- Learning objectives aren't quite right
- You have questions about feasibility

### How to Elaborate Effectively

**Ask specific questions:**

✅ **Good questions:**
```
"What activities would work for 15-year-olds instead of 18-year-olds?"
"Can you focus more on hands-on workshops and less on lectures?"
"Add an outdoor component for team-building"
"What would this look like as a 3-day event instead of 5 days?"
"How can we include participants with mobility limitations?"
```

❌ **Too vague:**
```
"Make it better"
"Change it"
"What else?"
```

**Build on previous responses:**

Elaboration is a conversation - each response builds on the last:

```
You: "What activities would work for 15-year-olds?"
AI: [Suggests age-appropriate activities]

You: "Focus more on hands-on workshops, less on lectures"
AI: [Refines activity list to be more interactive]

You: "Add outdoor team-building components"
AI: [Adds outdoor activities]

You: "Perfect! Include a reflection session at the end of each day"
AI: [Adds daily reflection sessions]
```

### What You Can Refine

During elaboration, you can adjust:
- Target group (age, background, special needs)
- Activity types (workshops, outdoor, cultural, sports)
- Duration and schedule
- Learning objectives and outcomes
- Partner countries
- Thematic focus
- Accessibility considerations

### When You're Done

When the seed feels right, click **"Convert to Project"** to create a full project with:
- Automatically generated phases
- Gantt chart timeline
- Detailed phase breakdowns
- Budget framework
- Participant structures

## The Seed Garden

Your **Seed Garden** is where saved seeds live.

**Access it:**
Dashboard → "My Seed Garden" or "Saved Seeds"

**In your garden, you can:**
- Browse all saved seeds
- Filter by theme, target group, or date
- Resume elaboration on any seed
- Convert seeds to projects
- Delete seeds you no longer need

**Best practices:**
- Save liberally - storage is unlimited
- Tag or note ideas for specific funding calls
- Revisit regularly - seeds can inspire new projects
- Delete outdated ideas to keep your garden clean

## Tips for Success

### 1. Generate Multiple Batches

Don't settle on your first batch. Try different prompts:
- Adjust the theme slightly
- Change the target group
- Vary the location or duration
- Explore different activity types

### 2. Save Promising Ideas

Even if you're not ready to act, save good seeds. They're valuable for:
- Future funding calls
- Partner discussions
- Inspiration when you're stuck
- Building a project portfolio

### 3. Use Elaboration Strategically

Not every seed needs elaboration:
- **Skip it** if the seed is already perfect
- **Use it** if you have specific questions or adjustments
- **Experiment** - elaboration is free and unlimited

### 4. Combine Ideas

See two seeds you like? Mention both during elaboration:
```
"Can you combine elements from 'Digital Nomads Unite' and 'Climate Champions'? I want the digital skills focus with environmental themes."
```

### 5. Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with a broad prompt, then use elaboration to narrow focus:
- Generate: "Youth exchange about sustainability"
- Elaborate: "Focus specifically on plastic reduction in coastal communities"

## Common Questions

**Q: How many seeds can I generate?**
A: Unlimited! Generate as many batches as you need.

**Q: How long does generation take?**
A: Typically 10-20 seconds for a full batch of seeds.

**Q: Can I edit seeds after saving?**
A: No, but you can elaborate them (which creates a refined version) or convert to a project and edit everything there.

**Q: Do I have to use seeds? Can I create projects directly?**
A: Seeds are optional but recommended. They help you explore ideas before committing to a full project.

**Q: Can I share seeds with colleagues?**
A: Not currently, but you can copy the text and share it manually. Team collaboration features are planned.

**Q: Will my seeds be deleted?**
A: No. Saved seeds remain in your garden indefinitely unless you delete them.

**Q: Can I regenerate the same prompt?**
A: Yes! Each generation will produce different ideas, so try the same prompt multiple times if you want more options.
