# Programme Builder - Detailed Activity Scheduling

## What is the Programme Builder?

The Programme Builder helps you create detailed, day-by-day schedules for your Erasmus+ project. It's where you transform high-level phase descriptions into concrete, timed activities that participants will experience.

## Why Build Detailed Programmes?

- **Clarity for partners** - Everyone knows exactly what's happening when
- **Realistic budgeting** - Activities drive meal, transport, and venue costs
- **Better applications** - Detailed programmes demonstrate thorough planning
- **Easier implementation** - When approved, you have a ready-to-use schedule
- **Identify issues early** - Spot logistical problems before they happen

## Accessing the Programme Builder

1. Open your project
2. Navigate to a phase (typically "Activities")
3. Click **"Programme Builder"** or **"Build Schedule"**

## Creating Your Programme

### Adding Days

1. Click **"Add Day"**
2. Set the date
3. Add day title/theme (optional)
   - Example: "Day 1: Arrival and Orientation"

### Adding Activities

For each day:

1. Click **"Add Activity"** on that day
2. Fill in activity details:
   - **Name** - Activity title (e.g., "Icebreaker Games")

## Best Practices

### 1. Balance Activity Types

Mix different formats:
- Don't schedule 6 hours of lectures
- Alternate sitting/moving activities
- Include social and educational content
- Build in reflection time
- Allow free time for informal learning

### 2. Be Realistic with Timing

**Allow extra time for:**
- Transitions between activities (10-15 min)
- Technical setup (10-20 min)
- Late arrivals
- Discussions running long
- Unexpected questions

**Common mistakes:**
- Back-to-back activities with no buffer
- Underestimating setup time
- No time for bathroom breaks
- Rushed reflection sessions

### 3. Front-load Important Content

Put critical activities early:
- Participants are fresh in mornings
- Later in programme, people are tired
- Early success builds confidence
- Important topics deserve prime time

### 4. Include Daily Reflections

End each day with reflection:
- What did we learn?
- How do we feel?
- Questions that arose?
- Links to tomorrow's content

**Benefits:**
- Deepens learning
- Builds group cohesion
- Surfaces issues early
- Required for quality Erasmus+ projects

### 5. Plan for Weather

If activities are weather-dependent:
- Have indoor backups
- Note this in activity descriptions
- Don't stack all outdoor activities in one day
- Check historical weather for your dates

### 6. Consider Energy Levels

**High-energy times:**
- Mid-morning (10:00-12:00)
- Early afternoon (15:00-16:00)

**Low-energy times:**
- Right after lunch (13:00-14:00)
- Late afternoon (17:00+)
- After travel days

Schedule complex activities when energy is high, social activities when it's low.

### 7. Build in Flexibility

Include:
- "Buffer time" slots
- "Flexible activity" options
- Free time for emergencies
- Optional activities for early finishers

This prevents schedule collapse when things run late.

## Accessibility Considerations

When planning activities, consider:

**Physical accessibility:**
- Can wheelchair users participate?
- Are venues accessible?
- Do activities require specific mobility levels?

**Cognitive accessibility:**
- Is language simple and clear?
- Are instructions visual and verbal?
- Is pacing appropriate?

**Sensory considerations:**
- Can hearing/vision impaired participate?
- Are materials available in alternative formats?
- Are quiet spaces available?

**Cultural sensitivity:**
- Are dietary restrictions accommodated?
- Are religious observances respected?
- Are cultural norms considered?

## Using AI for Programme Ideas

The AI assistant can help with programme design:

**Ask for suggestions:**
```
"Suggest 3 icebreaker activities for a group of 20 participants ages 16-18"
"What workshops work for a climate action project?"
"Give me a full-day schedule for cultural learning"
"Suggest team-building activities for an outdoor setting"
```

**Refine suggestions:**
```
"Make those icebreakers more physical and less sitting"
"Adapt that workshop for participants with limited English"
"Shorten the cultural tour to 2 hours instead of 4"
```

## Exporting Programmes

Your programme can be exported:

**As part of project export:**
- Included in PDF/Word documents
- Formatted for readability
- Includes all activity details

**As standalone schedule:**
- Print for participants
- Share with partners
- Post at venue
- Include in participant packs

## Common Questions

**Q: How detailed should activities be?**
A: Enough that someone else could facilitate using your description. Include what, how long, and key points to cover.

**Q: Can I change the programme after export?**
A: Yes! Edit anytime and re-export.

**Q: Do I need to fill in every hour?**
A: No. Include main activities, breaks, and meals. You don't need minute-by-minute schedules.

**Q: What if my programme changes during the project?**
A: That's normal! The programme is a plan, not a contract. Adapt as needed.

**Q: Can I copy programmes between projects?**
A: Yes, when using a project as a template, the programme comes with it.

**Q: Should I include travel time in the programme?**
A: Yes, at least for group travel. Individual travel might just be noted as "Arrival Day."

## Next Steps

With your programme built:
1. [Calculate accurate budgets](budget.md) - Activities drive costs
2. [Search for vendors](vendor-search.md) - You know what you need
3. [Export your project](export.md) - Programme is included
