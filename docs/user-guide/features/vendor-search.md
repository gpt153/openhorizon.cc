- Summer months (May-August) are busy

**Prioritize:**
1. Location (safe, accessible, near activities)
2. Facilities (meeting space, meals, accessibility)
3. Price (within budget)
4. Flexibility (cancellation terms)

**Questions to ask:**
- "Can we add 2-3 extra participants if needed?"
- "What's the cancellation policy?"
- "Is there space for team activities?"
- "Can we store equipment/materials?"
- "Are meals flexible for dietary restrictions?"

### Travel

**Green travel first:**
- EU prioritizes environmental sustainability
- Train/bus may qualify for extra funding
- Educational experience for participants
- Often easier for groups than flights

**Group bookings:**
- Airlines/trains offer group discounts
- Book together for better coordination
- Consider travel insurance
- Appoint travel coordinator

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's the group booking discount?"
- "Can we get flexible tickets (in case of visa delays)?"
- "What's included for luggage?"
- "Is there a group coordinator contact?"

### Food

**Dietary inclusivity:**
- Always offer vegetarian/vegan options
- Ask participants about allergies early
- Plan for religious dietary requirements
- Be flexible for unexpected needs

**Variety:**
- Don't eat same meals every day
- Include local cuisine
- Mix formal and casual meals
- Allow some free meals for exploration

**Questions to ask:**
- "Can you accommodate [specific dietary needs]?"
- "How much notice for menu changes?"
- "Can we adjust numbers day-of?"
- "Do you have experience with international groups?"
