## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Effective Seed Prompts

✅ **Good prompts include:**
- Theme or topic (e.g., "digital skills", "climate action")
- Target group (e.g., "youth ages 16-20", "youth workers")
- Countries or locations
- Rough duration

**Examples:**
```
"Youth exchange about climate action in Sweden, Poland, and Germany for ages 16-20"
"Training course for youth workers on digital storytelling, 5 days in Barcelona"
"Mobility project about social entrepreneurship for young adults from rural areas"
```

❌ **Avoid:**
- Single words ("project", "youth")
- Overly vague ("something about environment")
- Too specific/detailed (leave room for AI creativity)

---

### Using Elaboration Effectively

**Ask specific questions:**
- "What activities would work for 15-year-olds instead of 18-year-olds?"
- "Focus more on hands-on workshops and less on lectures"
- "Add an outdoor team-building component"

**Build conversationally:**
```
You: "What activities suit 15-year-olds?"
AI: [Suggests age-appropriate activities]

You: "Focus more on workshops, less on lectures"
AI: [Refines activity list]

You: "Add outdoor components"
AI: [Adds outdoor activities]
```

---

### Structuring Programmes

**Best practices:**
1. **Balance activity types** - Mix workshops, discussions, outdoor, cultural
2. **Include breaks** - 15-30 min between major activities
3. **Daily reflections** - End each day with learning reflection
4. **Build flexibility** - Buffer time for when things run late
5. **Consider energy** - Complex activities in morning, social in afternoon

**Sample day structure:**
```
09:00-09:30   Energizer
09:30-11:00   Workshop 1
11:00-11:30   Coffee break
11:30-13:00   Workshop 2
13:00-14:30   Lunch
15:00-17:00   Group activity
17:00-17:30   Daily reflection
18:30-19:30   Dinner
20:00-22:00   Free time / cultural evening
```
