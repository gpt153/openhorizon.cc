### Step 2: Generate Project Ideas

Your journey starts with "seeds" - AI-generated project ideas based on your brainstorming prompt.

1. From your dashboard, click **"Generate New Project Ideas"**
2. Enter a brainstorming prompt describing what you want to create

**Example prompts:**
- "Youth exchange about digital skills for rural youth in Sweden and Poland, ages 16-20"
- "Training course for youth workers on climate action, 5 days in Barcelona"
- "Mobility project about social entrepreneurship for young adults"

3. Click **"Generate"** and wait 10-20 seconds
4. Browse 5-15 AI-generated seed ideas, each with:
   - Informal and formal titles
   - Detailed descriptions
   - Target group and activities
   - Approval likelihood score
   - AI reasoning for why it's a good idea

**What to do with seeds:**
- **Save** - Add to your Seed Garden to revisit later
- **Elaborate** - Refine the idea through conversation with AI
- **Convert to Project** - Skip elaboration and create a full project immediately

### Step 3: Elaborate Your Seed (Optional)

If you want to refine an idea before creating a project:

1. Click **"Elaborate"** on your chosen seed
2. Have a conversation with the AI to refine details:
   - Ask about specific activities
   - Adjust target group
   - Refine learning objectives
   - Explore logistical details

**Example conversation:**
```
You: "What activities would work for 15-year-olds?"
AI: [Suggests age-appropriate workshops and outdoor activities]

You: "Focus more on hands-on workshops, less on lectures"
AI: [Refines activity list to be more interactive]

You: "Add outdoor team-building components"
AI: [Adds outdoor activities to the programme]
```

3. When satisfied, click **"Convert to Project"**

### Step 4: View Your Project

Once converted, your project appears with automatically generated content:

   - Special needs support
   - Organisational costs

**The calculator:**
- Uses official Erasmus+ unit cost tables
- Calculates distances automatically
- Updates in real-time as you change project details
- Shows breakdown by category

### Step 7: Find Vendors (Coming Soon)

Search for accommodation, travel, and catering options:

1. Navigate to **"Vendor Search"**
2. Choose category:
   - **Accommodation** - Hotels, hostels, youth centers
