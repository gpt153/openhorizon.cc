# ⚠️ ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE

## These directories are ARCHIVED and should NEVER be worked on

**Date Archived:** 2026-01-18
**Reason:** Project scope changed to focus EXCLUSIVELY on project-pipeline

### Archived Directories:

1. **`old-app-NEVER-USE/`** (formerly `/app`)
   - Old Next.js 16 + React 19 OpenHorizon platform
   - **STATUS:** DISCARDED AND ABANDONED
   - **DO NOT WORK ON THIS**
   - All work from Epic 003 (issues #154-162) was mistakenly done here
   - This cost 2 days and significant API costs due to miscommunication

2. **`landing/`**
   - Marketing landing page
   - **NOT PART OF CURRENT SCOPE**

### What Should You Work On?

**ONLY `/project-pipeline/`**

The project-pipeline is a Fastify backend + Vite React frontend for Erasmus+ project management.

### Current Task (2026-01-18):

Extend the seed elaboration system to automatically generate complete project skeletons with pre-populated phases, timelines, and budgets.

See: `/project-pipeline/PRD-INTELLIGENT-SEED-ELABORATION.md`

## If You're Reading This

You are probably a supervisor or agent. **STOP.**

**Ask yourself:** "Am I working on `/project-pipeline/`?"

- If YES: Continue
- If NO: **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and redirect to pipeline

---

## Lessons Learned

**2026-01-18:** Supervisor misunderstood "continue building" and worked on Epic 003 (Production Readiness) which was for the old `/app` directory instead of the seed elaboration feature in `/project-pipeline/`. This wasted 2 days and unknown API costs.

**Prevention:** All references to `/app` and `/landing` removed from active documentation. Only `/project-pipeline/` remains.

**IF YOU ARE WORKING ON ANYTHING IN THIS .archive/ DIRECTORY, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.**
