🌍 Open Horizon – Empowering Youth & Organisations Through Erasmus+
About Us

Open Horizon is a Swedish nonprofit association dedicated to creating meaningful international opportunities for young people and organisations through Erasmus+ projects. We specialise in inclusive youth exchanges, capacity building, and youth participation initiatives that build confidence, skills, and global understanding. The association focuses on ensuring participation for those with fewer opportunities and diverse needs.

Our work is grounded in values of inclusion, safety, quality, sustainability, and active participation. We believe that cross-cultural experiences empower young people to grow, connect, and contribute meaningfully to their communities.

What We Do
Youth Exchanges & Activities (Erasmus+ KA1)

Open Horizon designs and implements international youth exchanges and mobility activities for groups of participants aged 13–30. These are structured learning experiences involving workshops, cultural activities, discussions, and shared tasks across different countries. Funding covers travel, accommodation, activities, and logistic costs. Erasmus+ youth exchanges typically last between 5–21 days (excluding travel) and support non-formal learning, teamwork, language skills, and intercultural understanding.

Youth Participation Projects

We organise opportunities for young people to engage in civic, social, and political life through active programmes, workshops, and dialogues that amplify youth voices and encourage meaningful influence in local and international contexts.

Youth Worker Mobility & Training

Open Horizon supports the professional development of youth workers and leaders through training courses, study visits, job-shadowing, and networking initiatives. These activities promote best practices and strengthen the capacity of organisations and practitioners.

Inclusive Support & Accessibility

We prioritise inclusion by offering tailored support to participants with social, economic, geographic, or accessibility barriers. We adapt activities and provide individual support plans to ensure everyone can participate fully.

NEW SERVICE: Project Support & Implementation for Organisations

In addition to running our own programmes, Open Horizon now offers professional support services to other organisations who want to engage in Erasmus+ but need expertise in project design and delivery.

We can help your organisation to:

📌 Identify the right Erasmus+ opportunities
We assess your goals and match them to the most suitable Erasmus+ actions (youth exchanges, training, partnerships, capacity-building, etc.).

📌 Develop competitive project applications
We assist in writing and preparing complete Erasmus+ applications that meet eligibility, quality, and impact criteria.

📌 Plan and manage project implementation
From workplans and budgets to schedules and risk management, we support the operational delivery of your project.

📌 Reporting and follow-up
We prepare the required project reports, documentation, evaluation summaries, and dissemination measures — ensuring compliance with Erasmus+ requirements.

Open Horizon’s support services are ideal for nonprofits, schools, youth organisations, public bodies, and informal groups who want to maximise the impact of their Erasmus+ actions without the administrative burden.
