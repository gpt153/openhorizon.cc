## Why Archived?

These documents were archived on 2026-01-12 to:
1. **Reduce confusion** - Multiple old PRDs and reports cluttered the workspace
2. **Clear supervision** - New supervisor instances need clear, current documentation
3. **Preserve history** - Keep records of development process for reference
4. **Focus on current** - Make it obvious what's relevant vs historical

## Accessing Archived Files

All files remain accessible in this directory for reference. If you need to review historical decisions, implementation details, or past issues, they're all here.

**Do not use these files for active development** - they represent superseded versions and completed work.
