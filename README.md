## 📦 Project Structure

This is a **monorepo** containing two Next.js applications:

```
openhorizon.cc/
├── landing/              # Marketing landing page → openhorizon.cc
│   ├── src/app/         # Landing page routes
│   ├── Dockerfile       # Landing page container
│   └── package.json     # Landing dependencies
├── app/                  # Full application → app.openhorizon.cc
│   ├── src/             # Application source code
│   ├── prisma/          # Database schema
│   ├── Dockerfile       # App container
│   └── package.json     # App dependencies
├── cloudbuild-landing.yaml  # Deploy landing page
├── cloudbuild-app.yaml      # Deploy application
└── package.json            # Monorepo workspace root
```

### Domain Structure

- **openhorizon.cc** (root) → Marketing landing page for customers/partners
- **app.openhorizon.cc** (subdomain) → Full application

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies (both landing and app)
npm install

# Or install individually
cd landing && npm install
cd ../app && npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run landing page (port 3000)
npm run dev:landing

# Run application (port 3001)
npm run dev:app

# Or run individually
cd landing && npm run dev
cd app && npm run dev
```

**Landing page**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
**Application**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build landing page
npm run build:landing

# Build application
npm run build:app

# Or build individually
cd landing && npm run build
cd app && npm run build
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build landing page
docker build -t openhorizon-landing -f landing/Dockerfile landing

# Build application
docker build -t openhorizon-app -f app/Dockerfile app

# Run containers
docker run -p 3000:3000 openhorizon-landing
docker run -p 3001:3000 openhorizon-app
```

## ☁️ Cloud Run Deployment

**Automatic Deployment** via Cloud Build triggers:
- Push to `main` with changes to `landing/**` → Deploys landing page
- Push to `main` with changes to `app/**` → Deploys application

**Manual Deployment**:

```bash
# Deploy landing page
gcloud run deploy openhorizon-landing \
  --source landing \
  --region=europe-west1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --env-vars-file=env-landing.yaml

# Deploy application
gcloud run deploy openhorizon-app \
  --source app \
  --region=europe-west1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --env-vars-file=env-app.yaml
```

See `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for complete deployment guide.

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

OpenHorizon uses **Google Cloud Monitoring** with **OpenTelemetry** for comprehensive observability.

### Dashboard Access
- **Production Dashboard:** [Cloud Monitoring Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards?project=openhorizon-cc)
- **Alert Policies:** [Alerting](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting?project=openhorizon-cc)
- **Logs:** [Cloud Run Logs](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/europe-west1/openhorizon-app/logs?project=openhorizon-cc)

### Key Metrics Tracked

**System Performance:**
- Request count (total, by endpoint)
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (5xx responses)
- CPU/memory utilization
- Autoscaling instances

**Business Metrics:**
- Projects created (daily/weekly count)
- Searches completed (food, accommodation)
- Documents exported (PDF, Excel, Word)
- User signups

**Inngest Background Jobs:**
- Job completion rate (success vs. failed)
- Job duration (average, p95)
- Job failure rate (percentage)
- Job retry count

### Alert Notifications

Alerts are sent to `alerts@openhorizon.cc` for:
- ⚠️ Error rate > 1% (5 min sustained)
- ⚠️ P95 latency > 1s (5 min sustained)
- ⚠️ Inngest job failure rate > 10% (10 min sustained)
- ⚠️ Service inactive > 1 hour

### Setup Monitoring (First-Time)

```bash
# Run the monitoring setup script (one-time setup)
./scripts/setup-monitoring.sh

# This creates:
# - Email notification channel
# - 4 alert policies (error rate, latency, job failures, inactivity)
```

### Local Development

Metrics are **disabled by default** in development. To enable:

```bash
# In .env.local
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=openhorizon-cc
ENABLE_METRICS=true
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=openhorizon-app-dev
```

### Troubleshooting

**Metrics not appearing:**
- Check Cloud Logging for export errors
- Verify `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `ENABLE_METRICS` env vars
- Wait 2-5 minutes for data propagation

**Alerts not firing:**
- Verify notification channels are configured
- Check alert policy thresholds in Cloud Console
- Ensure email address is verified

**Dashboard empty:**
- Ensure app has traffic (metrics only appear after requests)
- Check that `ENABLE_METRICS=true` in production
- Wait up to 5 minutes for initial data

### Metrics Architecture

- **Frontend (Next.js):** tRPC middleware tracks all API calls
- **Backend (Fastify):** Plugin hooks track HTTP requests
- **Background Jobs (Inngest):** Each function wrapped with metrics
- **Export:** OpenTelemetry → Cloud Monitoring (60s interval)

See [Implementation Plan](.plans/issue-134-monitoring-observability-plan.md) for technical details.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take to create an Erasmus+ project with OpenHorizon?**
A: 4-6 hours with OpenHorizon (vs 40-60 hours manually). Transform weeks of planning into days.

**Q: Do I need technical knowledge to use OpenHorizon?**
A: No! OpenHorizon is designed for project coordinators, not developers. If you can use a web browser, you can use OpenHorizon.

**Q: What Erasmus+ actions are supported?**
A: Currently KA1 (Learning Mobility) and KA2 (Cooperation Partnerships). KA3 support coming soon.

**Q: Is my project data safe?**
A: Yes. All data is encrypted, GDPR compliant, and stored securely on EU servers. We do not share data with third parties.

**Q: Can I export to Word and PDF?**
A: Yes! Export to PDF, DOCX (Word), and XLSX (Excel) formats. All exports include your complete project details and Erasmus+ application forms.

**Q: Does OpenHorizon guarantee my application will be approved?**
A: No. OpenHorizon helps you plan and document high-quality projects, but approval depends on many factors reviewed by National Agencies.

**Q: Can I work on multiple projects simultaneously?**
A: Yes! Create and manage unlimited projects at the same time.

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Not yet. The web app works on mobile browsers but is optimized for desktop and tablet use.
